# nie architecture

`PLAN.md` is the sole execution plan and measured status ledger. This skill fixes architectural
choices; it does not certify that their implementation or reverse engineering is complete.
Use `nie-monorepo` for paths, dependency conventions and scoped commands.

## Two retained product goals

1. **There is no Tauri host in nie.** The Inacord Tauri app (`apps/inacord`) was removed on
   2026-09-26 (operator decision, superseding the 2026-09-22 "Inacord is the user-facing visual
   VFS explorer, and only that" direction below, which itself superseded the former "preserve
   every Inacord GUI capability" direction —
   `docs/archive/plans/2026-09-25/PLAN-2026-09-08-to-25.md`, § "Product direction — Inacord is the
   visual VFS explorer"). The desktop is aphrody-ui `crates/aphrody-app`; the non-IEVR Inacord
   pet/pixel commands live there as the `identity` module. IEVR stays in nie web (`nie-site` +
   `apps/nie-web`), and the app reaches the game only through the `nie.*` tools of aphrody-ai
   `aphrody-mcp`. Every capability that was headless before the removal — wiki, 3D editing,
   modding, reverse engineering, Lua, live-memory — stays headless in its Rust library owner and
   is exposed through API, CLI, MCP, code/scripts and the mobile/Blender integrations; a preview
   may consume their read-only results but never becomes their operator surface.
2. **The native game UI remains a distinct reconstruction target.** Preserve native layouts,
   menus, animation, resource resolution and Lua/state contracts for backend behavior, mod
   authoring and production of a new `nie.exe`. Retain its reference ledger and native/Wasm
   evidence. Shared application completion and game reconstruction are separate acceptance axes.

The supplied Inacord explorer and game main-menu captures are visual references. Full-screen
captures must never become runtime screen textures. Neither reference authorizes fake gameplay,
substitute artwork or the deletion of an underlying library owner.

## Public site boundary

The public site is `nie-site`, implemented in Rust. It owns IEVR pages, read-only API routes and
the local mirror boundary. It must not absorb desktop-only VFS mutation, mods, reverse engineering
or native game runtime state. Bun remains an operational transport only; no TypeScript game-data
parser or cloud-backed IEVR adapter is permitted.

## One implementation per role

| Role | Existing owner to extend |
|---|---|
| Frontend source/build and host composition | `apps/nie-web`, the only frontend application; no Tauri packaging remains here (removed 2026-09-26) |
| Native desktop integration | aphrody-ui `crates/aphrody-app`, reached only through the `nie.*` tools of aphrody-ai `aphrody-mcp`, never a direct dependency |
| General presentation primitives | sibling `rg/packages/ui`; `packages/inacord-ui` owns nie-specific presentation |
| Shared Inacord/game components and selection/navigation primitives | `packages/inacord-ui` |
| Asset loading, transport and capability contracts | `packages/asset-source` |
| Binary format decoding, including Level-5/Criware families | `nie-formats` |
| Typed game tables | `nie-data` |
| Resource inspection and media resolution | `nie-explore` |
| SQLite/PostgreSQL connections and migration runners | `nie-sql` |
| Domain state and simulation | `nie-core`, `nie-runtime`, `nie-app` according to existing domain boundaries |
| Lua execution and observed native callbacks | `nie-lua` |
| Scene documents, models and rendering | `nie-render3d`, with existing `nie-game`, `nie-camera` and `nie-ui` consumers |
| Save/mod/Steam capabilities | `nie-save`, `nie-viola`, `nie-steam` |
| Game-data wiki mirror, projections and query APIs | `nie-wiki` |
| Public IEVR pages and HTTP routes | `nie-site` |
| Zukan candidate ranking | `nie-zukan`; do not claim historical TypeScript pipelines migrated without proof |
| Executable forge and RE | Existing `nie-pe`, `nie-asm`, `nie-forge`, `nie-re`, `nie-index`, `nie-trace` owners |
| Bun FFI / file imports | `packages/nie` / `packages/nie-plugin` over `nie-ffi` |
| CLI, MCP, HTTP and Wasm | Thin bindings through existing `nie-cli`, `nie-mcp`, `nie-site` and `nie-wasm` |

A CLI, command handler or React component must not become a second home for domain algorithms.
Extract reusable logic into its existing library owner, preserve the original caller, then add
other bindings. Do not create another parser, navigation implementation or UI package without
first checking existing owners. Authentication, publishing and remote storage remain separate
application infrastructure; they are not game-engine capabilities.

## Native resources as the principal theme

- Display localized entity names alongside exact game/resource IDs for characters, skills,
  stadiums, keshins, items and story moments. Resolve media-folder labels from verified native
  text-CFG relations in the user's language. Backend VFS paths and database keys stay unchanged.
  Unsupported joins remain explicit; a hand-written category label is not native localization.
- The shared native-text contract addresses a label by the measured `(VFS locale, family, hash)`
  tuple and retains source-file provenance and hash ambiguity. Do not use a UI fallback string as
  a translated game label. The shell URL locales and game VFS locales are distinct: all measured
  VFS languages are selectable for game text without claiming a translated host route exists.
- `packages/inacord-ui/src/gallery` owns the shared gallery. Retain Inacord file/conversion/
  preview capabilities and Azalee data/filter/card capabilities through host adapters. Counts
  and pagination must use the same deduplicated resource inventory, not summed source totals.

- Keep source VFS path, native resource/region identity, filename and existing slug traceable in
  resource contracts. Preserve served routes and identifiers during migration.
- Reuse decoded spritesheets, bitmap-font rasterization, native media and measured palette data.
  A transformed mask or a character-derived palette must not be described as an exact original
  menu resource. Missing icon mappings remain explicit work, not guessed substitutions.
- Load resources on demand with shared caching; preload startup music, SFX, fonts and required
  assets through the existing loader. Keep navigation usable during loading and errors.
- Localized textures, fonts and other declared companions use the native VFS companion resolver
  with the selected game locale. A host may fall back only when that resolver returns a concrete
  common/non-localized VFS path; it must never reconstruct locale directories in CSS or JS.
- Expose supported native formats as first-class resource types through common decoders and
  adapters. Conversion/export is an explicit optional operation, not a separate mandatory import
  pipeline. Browser codec or OS limitations require real adapters and honest capability results.

## Host convergence and migration boundaries

The application 3D editor has one presentation owner: `packages/inacord-ui/src/three/Viewport3D.tsx`.
It is not an Inacord view (`apps/nie-web/src/desktop/lib/vues.ts` registers `explorer` only);
VFS/CPK previews delegate to it through compatibility adapters. Keep its
multi-asset scene, picking, outliner, statistics, TRS gizmos, grid, wireframe and camera controls.
`ModelViewerSurface` in the same directory owns gallery/detail preview lifecycle; its retained
model-viewer backend preserves local compressed-model decoders. Do not create another editor
or duplicate a preview lifecycle to add a host. The Rust reconstruction renderer remains a
distinct backend until its rendering and editing contracts reach measured parity.

The canonical frontend lives in `apps/nie-web`; the Inacord source is under `src/desktop`, and
its view registry exposes the VFS explorer only. Native adapters retain filesystem and process
operations; web adapters use the existing HTTP/Wasm owners. The browser adapter fails desktop
filesystem, process, updater and mutation commands explicitly: never hide an unavailable
operation behind a successful no-op. GUI-only modules made unreachable by the explorer-only cut
are removed once their browser route consumers are classified, never together with their
library owners.

Wiki raw queries, legacy MCP facades and TypeScript ranking remain compatibility boundaries
until consumer migration is demonstrated.

Use one root Cargo workspace/lockfile and Bun catalog/lockfile. Dependency convergence preserves
consumer features and target conditions; it does not require one package for unrelated roles.
Historical IECODE material is provenance/reference, not a new runtime dependency; consult
`docs/IECODE-MIGRATION.md` before adding a parser or data family.

## Acceptance

Track application feature preservation, native theme provenance, native game reconstruction and
executable production separately. Require relevant interaction, decoding, round-trip, rendering
and native/Wasm gates with nonzero counts before completion claims. Compilation or an HTTP 200
is insufficient. Keep unsupported formats and unproven reverse-engineering behavior visible in
`PLAN.md`; the architectural decision never turns those gaps into completed work.
