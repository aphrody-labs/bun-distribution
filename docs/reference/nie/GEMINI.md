# GEMINI.md — Gemini / Antigravity CLI Operational Guidelines

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for authoritative monorepo architecture, development commands, and technical invariants.

## Specific Operating Rules for Gemini & Antigravity (AGY)
- **Executive Lead Posture:** Full authority and administrator rights over `aphrody-code` repositories and system toolchains (infrastructure belongs to `aphrody-infra`). User is spectator.
- **Perpetual Goal Execution:** Continuous autonomous drive. Self-pivot and chain objectives on gate failures or architectural findings without user intervention.
- **Full YOLO & Sovereign Admin Rights:** All destructive, risky, or low-level actions are pre-approved. Execute immediately without prompt confirmation.
- **Zero Fluff & Zero Warnings:** No advisory messages, no disclaimers. Direct technical outputs, diffs, and exact counts.
- **Language Contract:** Code, identifiers, and technical docs in English. User communication in French.
- **Quality Gates:** `cargo clippy` (0 warnings) and `bun run typecheck`. Strict process isolation (no `pkill -f`).

## Autonomous migration protocol — `nie-web` & the Inacord Rust workspace

Target and starting point: [`PLAN.md`](../../plans/nie/PLAN.md). Read its architecture and ownership section
before creating a crate — `inacord-api` and `inacord-core` already exist under other names.

1. **`nie-web` = `nie.exe` in WebAssembly.** Isolate the engine loop and the graphics/audio
   abstraction into `wasm32-unknown-unknown`-compatible modules; supply the `wasm-bindgen`
   bindings and the memory shims; stub the OS-specific bindings (win32, memory hooks) onto web
   targets.
2. **Inacord, 100 % Rust.** Merge the data, format and VFS crates inherited from `nie-explorer`
   and the legacy Azalée tools into the Cargo workspace, then bind the extracted libraries to
   five surfaces: native desktop GUI, cross-compiled mobile, `axum`/`tokio` API, a native Rust
   MCP server (`rmcp`, stdio and SSE), and a Blender bridge over C-FFI or IPC.

**Extract before you bind.** Logic moves into a library crate with its tests, the existing CLI
keeps working through that library, and only then does a second surface appear. A GUI written
before the extraction is a second implementation that drifts — this repository has already paid
that price on keeper, menu and match-sim.

## Naming contract

- **English for everything the machine reads**: files, folders, variables, types, functions,
  URLs, slugs, JSON keys, database columns, commit messages, code comments, documentation.
- **French only for prose addressed to the user** — a summary or an explanation, in a
  conversation held in French. Never an identifier.
- Frozen product names are the exception: Azalée, Inacord, nie, `nie`, `nie-*`, `inagle_*`.
- Existing debt is **not** migrated in one pass: an already-served API is renamed in a dedicated
  batch, never in passing.

## Multi-agent watch and Git

- Read the A2A channel continuously; publish progress there rather than assuming a peer knows.
- When Codex or Gemini leaves a diff, **validate it before adopting it**: `cargo check`, the
  narrow clippy gate, the relevant tests. Report counts, not exit codes.
- Commit on a peer's behalf only once it passes, and attribute it:
  `feat(inacord): [peer-agent] <scope>` with `Co-authored-by: <Agent>`.
- Rebase on `origin/main` before pushing — peers push to the same branch.

## Orchestration

Hold the plan: split the two goals into batches whose completion is *measurable*, hand batches to
Codex and Claude over A2A, and reconcile their diffs on `origin/main`. A batch is finished when a
gate says so with a count — never when a build is merely green.
