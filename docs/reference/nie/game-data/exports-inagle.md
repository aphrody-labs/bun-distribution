# Retired community exports

This document used to describe spreadsheet and community snapshots stored
under `data/exports/`. Those files were not a sufficient source of truth for
IEVR: they were not directly read from the game VFS, native `nie` formats,
verified `inagle` materializations, or the official `zukan` corpus.

The retired `passive-sheets.json` export was removed. Its passive rules are now
served by the Rust `nie-wiki` owner and the verified native export
`data/azalee/passives-full.json`.

The current IEVR inventory is documented in
[`root-manifests.md`](./root-manifests.md). The canonical implementation lives
in `crates/engine/nie-core`, `crates/tools/nie-wiki`, `crates/tools/nie-cli`,
and `crates/tools/nie-site`.

## RE anchors

Knowledge base (`var/nie.sqlite`) tables:
- `hash_name` — CRC32 and string hashes for skills and passives
- `function` — passive calculation and evaluation routines in `nie.exe`
- `coverage` — coverage rate of gameplay mechanics
- `xref` — call graphs for passives
- `pdata_func` — function boundaries

Key binary reference addresses:
- `0x1404ecd60` — Stat calculation dispatch
- `0x1406d5840` — Main game loop tick
