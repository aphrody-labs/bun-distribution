# IEVR data manifests

This page describes the retained repository data under `data/azalee/`. The
directory contains only material that has a recorded origin in one of these
sources:

- the game VFS and its native CPK resources;
- a native `nie` export from those resources;
- a verified `inagle` mirror/materialization;
- the official `zukan` corpus.

The Rust crates own parsing and domain rules. JSON and compressed NDJSON files
in this directory are bounded generated indexes or verified materializations,
not a second database and not a replacement for the VFS.

## Retained files

| File | Origin | Purpose |

| `passives-full.json` | native `nie` export | Generated IEVR passive instances and scaling data |
| `skills-cutin.json` | native `nie` export | Skill cut-in metadata and native resource paths |
| `skills-cutin-served.json` | game VFS gate | Cut-ins whose required native resources exist |
| `zukan-audit.json` | official `zukan` plus verified mirror | Reconciliation report |
| `zukan/param_en.json` | official `zukan` | English character parameter corpus |

## Runtime data

The read-only `inagle_*` SQLite materialization is kept under `var/` and is
never copied into this directory or into an application package. The canonical
Rust mirror owner is `crates/tools/nie-wiki`; `crates/tools/nie-site` and
`crates/tools/nie-cli` are its native bindings.

Cloud schema snapshots, Supabase exports, community passive sheets, generated
game dumps, and external CDN inventories are not retained IEVR data sources.
`Cross` is a separate Unity game and remains outside this IEVR directory.

## Regeneration

Use the repository's Rust exporters or the bounded VFS index commands. Every generator must fail
closed when the required VFS, `nie`, or `zukan` source is absent; it must not fetch a
cloud database or silently substitute an external catalog.

## RE anchors

Knowledge base (`var/nie.sqlite`) tables:
- `hash_name` — CRC32 and string hashes for models, textures, cut-ins and passives
- `function` — VFS parsing and resource management in `nie.exe`
- `coverage` — coverage rate of asset resolution functions
- `xref` — call graphs for asset loaders
- `pdata_func` — `.pdata` function entry points

Key binary reference addresses:
- `0x140435320` — Resource manager search
- `0x140452ac0` — Resource manager register
