# Reverse-engineering center

The canonical reverse-engineering contract is [`docs/RE.md`](../../../reference/nie/RE.md); generated local data is
optional and is not required for a clean checkout.

`docs/re` intentionally contains only this lightweight entry point. Binaries,
VFS inventories, Ghidra projects, dumps, derived data, IECODE snapshots, and
machine-generated manifests live together under `data/re` so documentation
cannot drift into a second archive.

This directory complements
[`docs/COMPUTER-USE-RE-TRACE.md`](../../../reference/nie/COMPUTER-USE-RE-TRACE.md) for the `nie-re`/`nie-trace` bridge.

[`cmenulistview-fields.md`](../../../reference/nie/re/cmenulistview-fields.md) holds the one class reversed in depth here:
`lives::CMenuListView`'s engine-declared field table, its methods (vtable, scroll/page steps,
re-indexer, cell positions, the `OnEnter` notifier) and the traps met while reading them.
