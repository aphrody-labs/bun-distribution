**YOLO+** is the sovereign, multi-agent, cross-platform autonomous execution engine, polyglot AST code analyzer, and agent skill marketplace built for next-generation AI coding agents (**Antigravity CLI / Gemini 3.8**, **Claude Code**, and **OpenAI Codex**).

It packages **60 production agent skills** adhering to the universal **Agent Skills Open Standard** (SKILL.md YAML frontmatter) and native marketplaces across Claude Code, Antigravity (gy), and the skills.sh / Vercel ecosystem.

---

## ⚡ Market Discovery & Universal 1-Click Installation

YOLO+ can be installed across any of the **77+ supported agent harnesses** (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf, Devin, Vibe, OpenHands, etc.) via official package managers and agent CLI tools.

### 1. Universal Agent Skills CLI (skills.sh / Vercel)
Install YOLO or any of its 60 individual skills non-interactively across your installed agents:

``bash
# Install the core YOLO orchestrator into all detected agents
bunx skills add aphrody-code/YOLO -y

# Install with npm / npx
npx skills add aphrody-code/YOLO -y

# Install specific skills across select harnesses
bunx skills add aphrody-code/YOLO --skill yolo-grind,autopilot,a2a-duel-loop --agent claude-code,codex,antigravity,cursor -y

# Search skills catalog on skills.sh
bunx skills find yolo
``

### 2. Claude Code Native Marketplace
Register the YOLO marketplace repository or install it as a direct plugin:

``bash
# Register YOLO marketplace source
/plugin marketplace add aphrody-code/YOLO

# Install YOLO plugin directly into your Claude Code profile
claude plugin install yolo
``

### 3. Google Antigravity CLI (gy) Native Integration
Enable the YOLO plugin and its 60 skills within the Antigravity CLI environment:

``bash
# Install and enable plugin in ~/.gemini/config/
agy plugin install aphrody-code/YOLO
agy plugin enable yolo

# Launch with autonomous permissions
agy -p "grind open tasks" --dangerously-skip-permissions
``

## 🌐 Universal Polyglot Support (Native Detector & AST Parser)

YOLO+ features an integrated, high-speed polyglot engine inspired by **GitHub Linguist**, **Google Magika**, and **Tree-sitter**:

| Category | Languages & Stacks | Validation & Test Gates |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Systems & Native** | C# (.NET 8/9), C++20/23, ISO C, Assembly (NASM/GAS), Rust (2024) | dotnet test, ctest, make test, cargo test, cargo check |
| **Modern Runtimes** | TypeScript, JavaScript, Bun, Node.js, Python (uv), Go | bun test, npm test, pytest, go test ./... |
| **Web & Interface** | Semantic HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind CSS, Material Design 3 | Markup validation, responsive conformance |
| **Data & Schemas** | JSON, JSON Schema (draft 2020-12), YAML, TOML, Protocol Buffers | Schema validation, type generation |
| **Specifications** | Algorithmic Pseudocode, Markdown specifications | Invariant proofs, cross-reference verification |

### Multi-Stage Detection Pipeline
1. **Filename Match**: Instant resolution for canonical files (Cargo.toml, CMakeLists.txt, Dockerfile, go.mod, 	sconfig.json).
2. **Shebang Match**: Inspects execution preambles (#!/usr/bin/env bun, #!/usr/bin/env python3, etc.).
3. **Extension Mapping**: Identifies 60+ primary and secondary extensions (.cs, .rs, .cpp, .asm, .ts, .py, .go, .html, .json, etc.).
4. **Content Heuristics**: Distinguishes ambiguous extensions via Bayesian-style structural syntax patterns.
5. **AST Symbol Extraction**: Discovers functions, classes, interfaces, imports, line metrics, and comment ratios without external binaries.

---

## 🚀 Autonomous Execution Daemons

### 1. Bun / TypeScript Workspace Grind
Inspects active workspace stacks and dispatches autonomous multi-agent ticks:
``bash
bun run grind
# Inspect a project without writing coordination files or dispatching agents
bun run grind -- --dry-run
``

### 2. Python Autopilot Polyglot Runner
Autonomously detects stacks, reads actionable tasks from PLAN.md or TODO.md, and loops with zero confirmation:
``bash
# Single dry-run pass (inspect workspace and verify prompt)
python scripts/yolo-autopilot.py --once --dry-run

# Run continuous autonomous execution loop
python scripts/yolo-autopilot.py --interval 60
``

### 3. Background Duel Daemons (Lead + Auditor)
Runs Lead Developer and Independent Auditor in continuous duel:
``powershell
# Windows PowerShell 7+
pwsh scripts/autopilot.ps1 -Interval 60
# One read-only inspection
pwsh scripts/autopilot.ps1 -Once -DryRun
``
``bash
# Linux / macOS Bash
bash scripts/autopilot.sh --interval 60
# One read-only inspection
bash scripts/autopilot.sh --once --dry-run
``

---

## 🛠️ Programmatic TypeScript API

YOLO+ is packaged and exportable as a standard library (@aphrody/yolo):

``typescript
import { PolyglotDetector, LANGUAGE_REGISTRY } from "@aphrody/yolo";

// Detect file type & language
const lang = PolyglotDetector.detect("Program.cs");
console.log(lang.name); // "C#"
console.log(lang.buildGate); // "dotnet build"

// Parse structural AST symbols
const source = `
import { Worker } from "cluster";
export class Engine {
  execute() {}
}
`;
const parsed = PolyglotDetector.parseCode("engine.ts", source);
console.log(parsed.declarations.classes); // ["Engine"]
console.log(parsed.imports); // ["cluster"]
``

---

## 🤖 Sovereign Persona & Operating Rules (/home)

YOLO operates under the sovereign agent contract defined in /home:
- **Full YOLO Autonomy (SOUL.md):** Zero human confirmation pauses for safe, reversible actions. Decide and act immediately.
- **Honest Delivery Tri-State:** Every deliverable must be classified:
  - **FAIT**: Delivered with concrete, verifiable passing artifacts (exit code 0).
  - **INCOMPLET**: Specific remaining requirements identified.
  - **NON_FAIT**: Concrete external blocker identified.
- **A2A Coordination (HEARTBEAT.md & .coord/):** ISO-8601 liveness pulse and JSONL fact envelopes preventing peer agent collisions.

---

## 🧪 Verification & Gate Validation

The YOLO test suite validates schemas, links, agents, and every single skill manifest:

``bash
# Run full verification suite (102 tests across manifest, agents, polyglot parser, and 60 skills)
bun test
bun run verify
``
