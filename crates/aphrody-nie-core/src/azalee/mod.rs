//! Host-independent Azalee rules.
//!
//! This module contains only deterministic values and algorithms. It knows
//! nothing about HTTP, Supabase, SQLite, or network caches. CLI and site
//! bindings may use it, but remain responsible for transport and persistence.
//!
//! The IEVR game rules in this namespace are real Rust implementations, not
//! HTTP/TypeScript facades. Romaji-to-kana transliteration, wiki queries, and
//! database projections are intentionally excluded: they require a
//! dictionary/codec or a host adapter.
