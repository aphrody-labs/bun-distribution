//! Proton runtime: run the real `nie.exe` on Linux, as a direct child of this process.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! [`crate::lancement`] starts the game with a bare `Command::new(exe)`. That is correct on a
//! native Windows host, where `nie.exe` is executable. On Linux it cannot work: the PE needs an
//! interpreter, and the only supported one is the Proton shipped **with the game** under
//! `<game>/files` — it carries DXVK and vkd3d-proton, which the distribution Wine does not.
//!
//! Until now that whole chain lived in three shell scripts outside the binary
//! (`scripts/dev/nie-wine-setup.sh`, `scripts/dev/nie-wine-run.sh`, `scripts/boot-nie-direct.sh`).
//! Every constant below is transcribed from them; each one was paid for with a measured failure,
//! and the scripts' own comments record why.
//!
//! # The reason it belongs in this crate, and not next to the downloader
//!
//! Under `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=1`, `process_vm_readv(2)` is permitted only against a
//! **descendant** of the calling process. A shell script that launches the game makes the *shell*
//! the ancestor, so `nie mem` only works when it is started from that same shell. When the
//! process that launches the game is the one that later reads its memory, the permission holds by
//! construction — no `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, no `setcap`, and therefore no disturbance of the Vulkan
//! environment. See [`crate::wine_memory::likely_permitted`].
//!
//! # What this module does *not* do
//!
//! It does not start Xvfb or a window manager, and it does not neutralise EAC. [`doctor`] reports
//! those as prerequisites so a caller can tell which one is missing; [`crate::patch_eac`] handles
//! the second on an explicit copy.
