//! **`aphrody-nie-ocgen`** — the 3D generation pipeline for an original character.
//!
//! An OC exists as drawings and lore, and the game only knows `cfg.bin` documents and `20_EDIT`
//! meshes. This crate is the chain between the two, and it is deliberately made of stages that
//! each produce a file a human can read and check:
//!
//! | Stage | Input | Output |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`sources`] | `data/common/` dumps, `data/oc/<slug>/source/` | editor tables, decoded sheets |
//! | [`palette`] | sheets + declared regions | measured swatches, with provenance |
//! | [`morphology`] | the 16 `mdl_editpreview_avatar_*` documents | a starting model |
//! | [`recipe`] | starting model + swatches + bindings | a `CHARA_EDIT_PARAM` document |
//! | [`plan`] | the document + the checkout | what is still missing to assemble a mesh |
//!
//! ## What this crate claims, and what it does not
//!
//! It claims that the emitted document is in the game's own format: [`param`] parses the shipped
//! `edit_parameter.cfg.bin.json` and the sixteen morphology documents and re-emits each of them
//! **identically**, which is what the round-trip test checks. Everything the generator changes is
//! listed with the measurement that justified it.
//!
//! It does not claim the character renders, resembles its sheets, or loads in the game. No mesh is
//! assembled here: assembly needs the `20_EDIT` archives, and [`plan`] reports their absence
//! instead of substituting anything for them.
